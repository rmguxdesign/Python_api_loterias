# Gloom

Gloom will be a command line build generator. It reads a generator profile script and generates project files for other tools like Visual Studio, Xcode, or Make / GNU Make. This is intended to replace CMake, or Premake. Though I like Premake, simpler is better. It's built on nodejs for now and will be available soon.
